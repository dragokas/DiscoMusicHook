# Disco Music Hook
**Valve games proxy launcher to download and play music as soon as web-link is changed**

My old project since 2017, written on Visual Basic 6, alpha version.

Intended to create a convenient shortcut on desktop to run the game simultaneously with music links catcher.
The link is a harcoded string: https://dragokas.com/music/track.txt

As soon as a server-side change contents of this file (track.txt) with a web-link to a new music track, the hook on client-side is catching that, follow, download and play music of this track.

Not production ready, because:
 - Russian language only
 - No external settings
 - Binded to Left 4 Dead 1 game exclusively.

Initially, it is designed as a replacement/walkaround against MOTD issues in Valve games, which is blocked by Valve and always worked non-stable when music tracks played there.

Make your own fork, or suggest pull requests.
